            This is Jodie, she loves to take drugs and talk all kinds of shit about her friends.
            She is extremely self-centered and is completely incapable of using any kind of critical thinking.
            I think she might actually have some serious mental issues that are causing her problems,
            but the main problem is probably her friend Ayla "the train" Lucas.
